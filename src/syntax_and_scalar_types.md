# Syntax and Scalar Types

This section covers the basics of how to write a program in Gleam and represent
things like booleans (true/false states), numbers, and strings (of characters).

These simpler types of data that don't _contain_ anything are called "scalar
types" or scalars. We'll get into data types that wrap other types (e.g. lists)
in a bit.
